                            <p>
                                During the 2011 World-Cup Final against Sri Lanka, Malinga gets the two openers quite early. And when Virat got out after the crucial partnership between him and Gautam, MS comes to play and along with Gautam led the team to the victory. Unfortunetly Gautam missed his Century by 3 runs but when 4 runs in 11 balls are needed MS hits a Winning six and won the Cup in his style.
